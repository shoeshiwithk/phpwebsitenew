                    PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source scripting language primarily designed for web development. It is embedded within HTML and enables dynamic content creation and interaction with databases. PHP was initially created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993, and over the years, it has evolved into a powerful tool for building web applications. One of its main strengths is server-side scripting, allowing developers to generate content tailored to each userâ€™s request, process forms, and manage session data. PHP works seamlessly with MySQL, making it ideal for database-driven websites. Its versatility is enhanced by extensive libraries, frameworks (like Laravel and Symfony), and broad support in web hosting environments. PHP is also known for its large community of developers who contribute to its continuous improvement.
